# Deploy MobiusFlow速 to Your Fleet

After signing up to [balena.io](https://www.balena.io) follow their instructions to create a fleet and add your first device. We have simplified the process so you will only need to perform some of the actions they list. The steps below outline the process but for more information see the balena.io [documentation](https://docs.balena.io/learn/getting-started/raspberrypi3/nodejs/#create-a-fleet).

## What You Will Need?

1. A **balena.io account** with Microservices access (this requires a paid account)
2. A compatible balenaCloud fleet (Up Board, Intel NUC or Raspberry Pi 4)

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should always backup your MobiusFlow速 device before deploying a new version.

See [Backup and Restore](../mobiusflow-r/backup-and-restore.md) for more details
