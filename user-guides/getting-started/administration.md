# Administration

The Administration page covers user management, backup and restore, licence settings, security as well as setting the node's Hub ID. The page is divided into corresponding tabs accordingly.

## User administration <a href="#nodeadministration-useradministration" id="nodeadministration-useradministration"></a>

Users can be added, modified and deleted from within the User Management Tab on the Administration page.

## Backup/Restore <a href="#nodeadministration-backup-restore" id="nodeadministration-backup-restore"></a>

Backup and restore functionality is accessed via the settings tab on the Administration page. A full article covering backup and restore can be found [here](../../technical-docs/mobiusflow-basics/backup-and-restore.md).

## Setting the Hub ID <a href="#nodeadministration-settingthehubid" id="nodeadministration-settingthehubid"></a>

All Mobius nodes are identified by their hub ID. This is a six character hexadecimal number and should be unique within any group of Mobius nodes. See [MobiusFlow Architecture](../../technical-docs/mobiusflow-basics/mobiusflow-architecture.md) and [MobiusFlow Uniform Resource Identifiers](../../technical-docs/mobiusflow-basics/mobiusflow-uniform-resource-identifiers-uris.md) for more information about Hub IDs.
