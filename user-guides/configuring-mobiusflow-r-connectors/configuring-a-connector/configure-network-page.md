# Configure Network Page

## Select Network Type

You can choose to use a **wired** or **wireless** (2.4GHz WiFi) connection to connect a connector to your **Mobius**FlowÂ® instance

Select your network type using the Connect Via dropdown. The page layout will change depending on the option selected

When using a **wireless** connection you need to enter the WiFi network's **SSID** (name) and **password**. You can click on the **Scan WiFi Networks** button to get a list of available WiFi networks

You can set a **connection timeout** in minutes. If the connector fails to connect to a network within this time it will reboot and try again

## Select TCP/IP Mode

You can choose to use a DHCP server to allocate the connector an IP Address or set a static IP Address. If you choose to use a static IP Address a few more options will be shown. Set these according to your network
