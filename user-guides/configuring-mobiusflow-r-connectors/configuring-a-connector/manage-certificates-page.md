# Manage Certificates Page

## Setting CA / Server Certificates

When using TLS you will need to set the correct CA / Server certificates. You can have up to three certificates set. If the connector fails to connect using one of the certificates it will cycle through all three, trying each one until it connects

The default certificates are **ISRG Root X1** certificates which are used when connecting to **Mobius**Flow® hosted instances of **Mobius**Flow®

You can set the certificate by pasting the certificate text into the selected certificate slot

## Setting Client Certificate and Keys

If your setup requires the use of Client certificates you can set up to four different certificates and keys. Paset these into the selected certificate and key slots &#x20;
