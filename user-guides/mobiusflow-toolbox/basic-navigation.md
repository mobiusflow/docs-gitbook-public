## Navigation

Navigating around the Toolbox UI is very simple. The key areas are as follows:

* The current user is shown in the top right of the window. You can click on this button to change your password or log out
* The collapsable menu on the left side of the window is a quick way to access your configured Services, Flows, Historian settings, Object Profiles and instance Settings. Clicking on the menu icon in the the top left corner will either collapse or expand the menu. As you add new [services](services.md) to your configuration they will shown in the menu under the Services heading
* With the exception of Flows, clicking on an item in the left menu will show the view for that selection in the main view. Clicking on Flows will open the Flows window in a separate browser tab, or navigate to that tab if it is already open
* Configuration of specific items such as services, objects and profiles will be shown in a pane to the right of the main view. This pane is only visible when a configurable item is selected
