# Services

MobiusFlow Services are the starting point for any configuration. They are typically device drivers for a specific protocol or provide protocol interfaces such as an MQTT broker.

The main services page shows an overview and status of each service that has been added to the configuration. You can interact with services in a number of ways, including configuring a service, starting and stopping a service, or adding and configuring objects belonging to a service.

{% hint style="info" %}
MobiusFlow includes a number of pre-configured [system services](system-services.md) that you may or may not be able to interact with in the normal way. These include the Engine API and Historian services
{% endhint %}

## Adding Services

As each application differs you will need to chose which services are required for your application.&#x20;

To add a service, first click on the Show Library button to show the list of available services, find the service you want to add, and click on the Add button for that service.

The service will get added to the configuration with the next available Service ID (SID)

You can click on the Hide Library button to hide the service library when you are done.
