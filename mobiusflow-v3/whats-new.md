# What's New?

MobiusFlow V3 has been built from the ground up. We have listened to your feedback and added a host of new features to make MobiusFlow even more powerful and easier to use.

Tagging, we added it, custom object profiles, there too, and to make you even more productive we have added the ability for you to write your own data pre-processors and codecs. We are excite about these new features and are sure you will be too!

## Engine and Toolbox

Both the MobiusFlow Engine (the heart of MobiusFlow) and MobiusFlow Toolbox have been completely rewritten to be more efficient and easier to use.&#x20;

## Value Persistence

The data stored in MobiusFlow objects can now be persisted between restarts of a service. No longer will temperate values drop to zero, people counts be lost, and energy readings disappear when services are restarted! Persistence can be configured on a service by service basis and values are included in backups

## Tagging

Powerful tagging features have been added to both objects and resources. Tags can be defined on object profiles so that they are automatically added to each instance of an object, and added to individual object instances.&#x20;

You can use simple tags or add values to tags. Tags are included as metadata when reading values or receiving change-of-value events via the new API.

For version 3 we have chosen to use epoch versioning so don't be surprised that our new software versions start from 3000
