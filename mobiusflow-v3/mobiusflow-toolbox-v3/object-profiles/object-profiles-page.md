The object profiles table shows a list of all of the profiles that exist on this instance of MobiusFlow. Any profiles that have not been used to create objects, and therefore can be deleted are shown with a greyed out PID and icon.

Above the table is a toolbar with options to&#x20;

* Create a new profile
* Filter the list by profile group
* Search for a profile - this filters by PID and profile name
* Import and export profiles
* Set the density of the grid
