# Tags

Tags are a powerful way to organise your objects and resources making it easier to find and group similar pieces of data.

Tags can be a simple key word or phrase (much like a hashtag in social media apps) or a keyword or phrase with an associated value.

## Managing Tags

Tags can be added to [object profiles](object-profiles/) and individual object instances. Any tags added to an object profile will be automatically added to all objects created from that profile.

### Managing Object Profile Tags

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### &#x20;Select the object profile

Open the [Object Profile Editor](object-profiles/editing-profiles.md) and select the profile you wish to manage

The profile editor sidebar will appear. Make sure that the Profile Settings pane is selected in the sidebar

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Adding tags

{% hint style="success" %}
Tag names are case sensitive can have spaces so `air_quality`, `air quality` and `Air Quality` are all valid tag names but are deemed different tags
{% endhint %}

#### Adding a simple tag

In the **Add a tag** textbox type in the tag name and press **Enter**

The new tag will appear in the tag list

#### Adding a tag with value

In the **Add a tag** textbox type in the tag name followed by **=** and then the value e.g `floor = 1`

Press **Enter** and the tag will appear in the tag list

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to add a space either side of the equals sign. All white space will be stripped away
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
