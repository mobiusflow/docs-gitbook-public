# Adding Services

As each application differs you will need to chose which services are required for your application.

To add a service, first navigate to the [Services](../../mobiusflow-toolbox/services/) page and then click on the Show Library button to show the list of available services, find the service you want to add, and click on the Add button for that service.

The service will get added to the configuration with the next available Service ID (SID)

You can click on the Hide Library button to hide the service library when you are done.
