# Deleting Services

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting a service also deletes all of its objects. This action cannot be undone!

To delete a service, first navigate to the [Services](../../mobiusflow-toolbox/services/) page and then find the correct service card.

In the service card toolbar click on the **Delete** button. A confirmation dialog will appear. Enter the text shown (you can click on the copy icon to save typing) and click **Confirm**.
