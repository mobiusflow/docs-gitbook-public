# Accessing a Service's Objects

## Overview

All MobiusFlow [Objects](accessing-a-services-objects.md) must belong to a service. To add, delete, modify, and view a service's objects you can either click on the main body of a service card on the [Service](../../mobiusflow-toolbox/services/)'s page or click on the service in the main menu.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot access the objects page for [System Services](../../mobiusflow-toolbox/services/system-services.md).
{% endhint %}

For more information on managing objects please refer to the [Objects](../objects/) page.
