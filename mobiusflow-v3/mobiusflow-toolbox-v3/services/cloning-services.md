# Cloning Services

## Overview

To create a copy of a service along with all of its settings and objects you can click on the Clone button on the service card of the service you want to copy. The new service will be given the next available [SID](../../mobiusflow-overview/mobiusflow-uniform-resource-identifiers-uris.md). You can change the SID in the service's settings if required.
